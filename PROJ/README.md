# PROJ Method (Exotic/Vanilla Options)
Option pricing (exotic/vanilla derivatives) based on an efficient and general Fourier transform pricing framework - the PROJ method (short for Frame Projection). The modules are organized by Model, and then by Contract Type. Each contract has a run script, which starts with "Script_", e.g. "Script_BarrierOptions.m".
